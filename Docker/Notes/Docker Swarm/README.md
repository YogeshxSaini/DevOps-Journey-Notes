<h1 align="center"> Docker Swarm </h1>

Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration tool for Docker containers. It allows you to create and manage a cluster of Docker nodes, which can be used to deploy and scale containerized applications.

## Features of Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm offers several features that make it a powerful tool for managing containerized applications:

- High availability: Docker Swarm ensures high availability by replicating containers across multiple nodes in the cluster.
- Scalability: Docker Swarm allows you to scale your applications by adding or removing nodes from the cluster.
- Load balancing: Docker Swarm provides built-in load balancing for distributing traffic across multiple containers running on different nodes.
- Service discovery: Docker Swarm includes a built-in DNS server for service discovery within the cluster.
- Rolling updates: Docker Swarm supports rolling updates, which allow you to update your applications without downtime by gradually updating containers across the cluster.

## Components of Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm consists of the following components:

- **Swarm manager**: The Swarm manager is responsible for managing the cluster and coordinating tasks across the nodes.
- **Swarm nodes**: The Swarm nodes are the individual Docker hosts that make up the cluster.
- **Service**: A service is a containerized application that is deployed and managed by Docker Swarm.
- **Task**: A task is a running instance of a service on a particular node.

### For Loop in Shell Scripting

#### Definition:
The "For" loop in shell scripting allows you to iterate over a list of items and perform a set of commands for each item in the list. It's commonly used for tasks such as processing files, iterating over arrays, or performing repetitive operations.

#### Syntax:
The syntax of a "For" loop in shell scripting is as follows:
```bash
for item in list; do
  # Commands to execute for each item
done
```
- `item` is a variable that represents each item in the list.
- `list` is a sequence of items separated by spaces.

#### Example Usage:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Iterate over a list of fruits
for fruit in Apple Banana Orange; do
  echo "I like $fruit"
done
```
Output:
```
I like Apple
I like Banana
I like Orange
```

#### Iterating Over a Range:
You can also use a "For" loop to iterate over a range of numbers using the `seq` command.
```bash
for num in $(seq 1 5); do
  echo "Number: $num"
done
```
Output:
```
Number: 1
Number: 2
Number: 3
Number: 4
Number: 5
```

#### Iterating Over Files:
You can use a "For" loop to iterate over files in a directory.
```bash
for file in *.txt; do
  echo "Processing file: $file"
done
```

#### Important Notes:
- Ensure that the list provided to the "For" loop is properly formatted and contains the necessary items.
- Use quotes around variables to handle spaces and special characters in item names.
- "For" loops can be nested within other loops or conditional statements for more complex iterations.

#### Summary:
The "For" loop in shell scripting provides a convenient way to iterate over lists of items and perform actions for each item. Whether it's processing files, iterating over arrays, or performing repetitive tasks, understanding how to use "For" loops is essential for writing efficient shell scripts.

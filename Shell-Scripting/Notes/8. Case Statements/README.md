### Case Statements in Shell Scripting

#### Definition:
Case statements in shell scripting provide a way to perform different actions based on the value of a variable. They are particularly useful when you have multiple conditions to check against a single variable.

#### Syntax:
The syntax of a case statement in shell scripting is as follows:
```bash
case expression in
  pattern1)
    # Commands to execute if expression matches pattern1
    ;;
  pattern2)
    # Commands to execute if expression matches pattern2
    ;;
  *)
    # Default commands to execute if no pattern matches
    ;;
esac
```
- `expression` is the variable or value to be matched against patterns.
- `pattern1`, `pattern2`, etc., are the patterns to match against `expression`.
- `*)` is a wildcard pattern that matches any value.

#### Example Usage:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a variable
fruit="Apple"

# Check the value of the variable using a case statement
case $fruit in
  "Apple")
    echo "It's an apple."
    ;;
  "Banana")
    echo "It's a banana."
    ;;
  "Orange")
    echo "It's an orange."
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Unknown fruit."
    ;;
esac
```
Output (if `fruit="Apple"`):
```
It's an apple.
```

#### Using Patterns:
- Patterns in case statements can include wildcards, such as `*` (matches any string) and `?` (matches any single character).
- You can also use character ranges, such as `[a-z]` or `[0-9]`, to match a range of characters or digits.

#### Example with Pattern Matching:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if a file extension is .txt, .pdf, or .docx
file="document.pdf"

case $file in
  *.txt)
    echo "Text file."
    ;;
  *.pdf)
    echo "PDF file."
    ;;
  *.docx)
    echo "Word document."
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Unknown file type."
    ;;
esac
```

#### Important Notes:
- Case statements provide a concise way to handle multiple conditions based on the value of a variable.
- Be mindful of the order of patterns in a case statement, as the first matching pattern will be executed.
- Use a wildcard pattern (`*`) or a default case (`*)`) to handle values that don't match any specific pattern.

#### Summary:
Case statements in shell scripting allow you to perform different actions based on the value of a variable. Whether it's checking file extensions, processing user input, or handling different types of data, understanding how to use case statements is essential for writing flexible and efficient shell scripts.

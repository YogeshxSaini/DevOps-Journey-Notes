### Conditional Logic in Shell Scripting

#### Definition:
Conditional logic in shell scripting involves making decisions based on conditions. It allows scripts to execute different code paths depending on the evaluation of one or more conditions.

#### Conditional Constructs:
1. **if Statement**:
   - The `if` statement allows you to execute a block of code if a condition is true.
   - Syntax:
     ```bash
     if [ condition ]; then
       # Code to execute if condition is true
     fi
     ```

2. **if-else Statement**:
   - The `if-else` statement allows you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.
   - Syntax:
     ```bash
     if [ condition ]; then
       # Code to execute if condition is true
     else
       # Code to execute if condition is false
     fi
     ```

3. **if-elif-else Statement**:
   - The `if-elif-else` statement allows you to evaluate multiple conditions sequentially and execute different blocks of code based on the first condition that is true.
   - Syntax:
     ```bash
     if [ condition1 ]; then
       # Code to execute if condition1 is true
     elif [ condition2 ]; then
       # Code to execute if condition2 is true
     else
       # Code to execute if all conditions are false
     fi
     ```

#### Conditional Operators:
- Shell scripting provides various operators for comparing values and evaluating conditions, such as:
  - `-eq`: Equal to
  - `-ne`: Not equal to
  - `-lt`: Less than
  - `-le`: Less than or equal to
  - `-gt`: Greater than
  - `-ge`: Greater than or equal to
  - `-z`: Checks if a string is empty

#### Example Shell Script with Conditional Logic:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define variables
age=20

# Check if age is greater than or equal to 18
if [ $age -ge 18 ]; then
  echo "You are an adult."
else
  echo "You are a minor."
fi
```

#### Important Notes:
- Conditional logic in shell scripting allows you to control the flow of your script based on conditions.
- Ensure proper syntax and spacing when writing conditional statements to avoid errors.
- Use meaningful variable names and conditions to make your code more readable and maintainable.

#### Summary:
Conditional logic in shell scripting enables scripts to make decisions based on conditions. Whether it's simple if statements or complex if-elif-else constructs, understanding how to use conditional constructs and operators is essential for writing dynamic and flexible scripts.
